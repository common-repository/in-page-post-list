== Description ==

Show a list of posts inside of a page or a post. For example, you might
write a page about dogs, and you want the page to display all your
recent posts about dogs. Simple! Just put this in your page:
[inpagepostlist_search dogs]
Currently you can search by term, by tag, and by
category. Also, each method of search has an optional "count=number_of_posts".
By default 10 items are shown. You can show a larger or smaller number of posts
by changing that option.
[inpagepostlist_search dogs count=3] (shows 3 posts that contain the search term dog)
[inpagepostlist_tag animals] (shows 10 posts tagged as animals)
[inpagepostlist_category Dog Stories count=30] (shows 30 posts in the category Dog Stories)

By default, if you use this plugin, it will display a small link at the
bottom of your post to my website. This can be removed by editing the plugin
and commenting out the line at the bottom of the plugin that contains the link.
I do appreciate any credit, but I understand that if you use lots of plugins
on your WordPress site that your site will be 30% content and 70% credits. So,
no hard feelings at all if you remove the little credit line.

Also, any comments, fixes, suggestions, etc are welcome.

== Installation ==

Standard installation. If you don't know how to install manually, then
consider installing directly from the WordPress.org plugin repository.
It's very easy and then I can't make any mistakes in my instructions.
There is no need to configure the plugin in any way. Once it's active,
it aready does what it needs to do.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

It's a new plugin. No one has asked any questions yet. Send me questions
and then they might be included.
